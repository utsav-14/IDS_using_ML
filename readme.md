# Intrusion Detection using ML

In this project, we used different machine learning models to discriminate between normal network behaviour and an attack.

# Dataset:

UNSW NB-15

# Models:

- Linear Classifiers(Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Ensemble Classifiers(Random Forest, XGBoost)
- ML based classifiers(MLP, Fully connected NN)
